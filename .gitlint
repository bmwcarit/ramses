[general]

# verbosity should be a value between 1 and 3, the commandline -v flags take precedence over this
verbosity = 3

# Enable debug mode (prints more output). Disabled by default.
# debug=true

[title-max-length]
line-length=90

# [title-must-not-contain-word]
# Comma-separated list of words that should not occur in the title. Matching is case
# insensitive. It's fine if the keyword occurs as part of a larger word (so "WIPING"
# will not cause a violation, but "WIP: my title" will.
# words=wip

# [title-match-regex]
# python like regex (https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html) that the
# commit-msg title must be matched to.
# Note that the regex can contradict with other rules if not used correctly
# (e.g. title-must-not-contain-word).
# regex=^US[0-9]*

[body-max-line-length]
line-length=80

# [body-min-length]
# min-length=5

# [body-is-missing]
# Whether to ignore this rule on merge commits (which typically only have a title)
# default = True
# ignore-merge-commits=false

# [body-changed-file-mention]
# List of files that need to be explicitly mentioned in the body when they are changed
# This is useful for when developers often erroneously edit certain files or git submodules.
# By specifying this rule, developers can only change the file when they explicitly reference
# it in the commit message.
